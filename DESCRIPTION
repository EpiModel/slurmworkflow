Description: slurmworkflow makes it possible to locally pre-define a set of jobs
    to be run on a slurm equipped HPC. A workflow is a set of steps to be run
    on the HPC (sequentially by default). slurmworkflow provides tools to alter
    the execution order, allowing conditional execution of the steps and loop
    like behavior.
